# Customer CRUD

This is a simple Customer Full Stack Application with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Running Locally

This project consists of two submodules: `api` and `ui`. Both are co-located in a separate directory, and each has its own `README.md` file for instructions.

- [Instructions for API](https://github.com/jericdei/customer-api/blob/main/README.md)
- [Instructions for UI](https://github.com/jericdei/customer-ui/blob/master/README.md)
